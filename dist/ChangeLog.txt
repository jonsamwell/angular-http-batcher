23/05/2015 V1.7.1
Adding support for java servlet spec <= 3.1 and Spring MVC, to deal with the way multipart requests are parsed in Java.

16/03/2015 V1.7.0
Fixed issue with parsing the response string into a json object with having more than two dashes '--' in the returned data.

12/01/2015 V1.6.0
Added a flush method to the httpBatcher service which will immediately send all the pending batch requests regardless of batch quota or time limits being hit.

19/11/2014 V1.5.0
When batching requests that have request bodies, such as "POST" requests, the standard angular request transforms convert objects into json strings.
When angular-http-batcher calls angular.toJson again, we end up with a single json string, instead of a json encoding of the object in the batched request.
So remove this un-necessary call so a json encoding of the object is sent rather than a escaped json string to improve webAPI parameter binding.

So, instead of {"name":"John"} as the body of the request in the batch, you get "{\"name\":\"John\"}" - which causes the parameter binding in Web API to break.

19/11/2014 V1.4.0
The batch response parser can now handle multi-line json.

18/11/2014 V1.3.0
Fixed issue with relative urls

19/09/2014 V1.2.0
Fixed issue when {cache: true} on requests as the module was returning the headers as an object.  However, it the request is to be cache angular expects the headers to
be a string.

27/08/2014 V1.1.0
Fixed bug when a request hit the batch collection timeout and the request have not reached the min batch size the pending
request is not moved which forces other request to have sending delays.
